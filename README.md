# Kanban-board

## Overview
- Interactive Kanban Boards: Users can create multiple Kanban boards, each representing a project or workflow. Within each board, tasks can be organized into columns representing different stages of progress (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").

- Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Tasks on the Kanban board can be easily moved between columns using simple drag-and-drop gestures, making it convenient to update task statuses.

- The application allows users to set task priorities (e.g., high, medium, low) to ensure a clear focus on critical tasks.

- Deadline Tracking: Users can assign due dates to tasks

- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, ensuring a seamless user experience across platforms.
